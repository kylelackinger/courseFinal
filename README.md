## This repo contains data obtained from the following reference:

* Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012

Original subject matter for the data set was activity recognition of 
## humans using smartphone data.  The data was pulled from onboard smartphone
## sensors, specifically triaxial accelerometer and a gyroscope.  The data
## taken from these sensors has already been preprocessed by the original 
## team.

## The experiments carried out involved 30 volunteers that carried a Samsung
## smartphone on their hip.

## The raw dataset was obtained from the UCI repository at the following link

## The courseFinal repo contains the following:

* A data folder with all raw data from the UCI repository
* Codebook.md describing information about the variables seen in the raw data set and summary decisions
* run_analysis.R script which loads the required data and processes
